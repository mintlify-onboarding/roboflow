Annotation Insights show statistics on annotation jobs for projects in a workspace. You can view insights by date, labeler, and project.

For example, you can find:

1. 1.  
How many images someone annotated in a given time frame;

2. 2.  
How many images were rejected during the approval stage for a project;

3. 3.  
How many bounding boxes were drawn for a project;

4. 4.  
Time spent labeling, and more.
