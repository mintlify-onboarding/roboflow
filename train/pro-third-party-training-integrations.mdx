4\. Copy **KEY 1** from your Microsoft Azure account to the **"training-key"** in Roboflow

_NOTE: For datasets larger than 1000 images, Azure will require S0 pricing tier._

5\. Update the **Endpoint** field in Roboflow to match the **Endpoint** field from your Microsoft Custom Vision project.

From here, you're ready to start training with Roboflow and Microsoft Custom Azure together. Steps 1-5 only need to be completed once. To continue training with Azure, proceed.

### Training in Azure Custom Vision

6\. Once you've generated a dataset version, export the project as "Azure Custom Vision."

(Note: ensure you're logged into your Microsoft Azure account in the same browser as your Roboflow account.)

Your exported dataset version will appear directly in your Azure account.
