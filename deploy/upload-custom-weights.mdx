title: "Upload Custom Weights"
---

Once you've completed training your custom model, upload your model weights back to your Roboflow project to take advantage of [Roboflow Inference](https://inference.roboflow.com/).

Model weights uploads are currently available for:

* YOLOv5 (n, s, m, l, x) Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

* YOLOv7 Instance Segmentation (yolov7-seg)

* YOLOv8 (n, s, m, l, x) Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Classification

After successfully training your custom YOLOv5, YOLOv7 or YOLOv8 model, use the `.deploy()` function to upload your model weights back to your Roboflow Object Detection project.

Model weights uploads are only available for dataset versions _without_ a trained model (i.e not yet trained with Roboflow Train, and no YOLOv5, YOLOv7 or YOLOv8 model weights uploaded).

NOTE: _Larger model sizes provide better training results. However, the larger the model size, the slower the training time, and inference (model prediction) speed_. Consider whether you're looking for real-time inference on fast-moving objects or video feeds (better to use a smaller model), or you are processing data _after_ it is collected, and more concerned with higher prediction accuracy (choose a larger model).

### Upload Custom Weights

Python SDK

You need `roboflow>=1.0.1` and ultralytics==8.0.196 to use the`.deploy() `command.

To upload custom weights, use the `model.deploy()` method in the Python SDK.

```
version = project.version(1)
version.deploy("model-type", "path/to/training/results/")
```

The following model types are supported:

* yolov5, yolov5-seg

* yolov7, yolov7-seg

* yolov8, yolov8-seg, yolov8-cls

If weights upload is attempted for dataset versions that already have a trained model (a Roboflow Train model or uploaded YOLOv5, YOLOv7 or YOLOv8 weights) then you will receive a `RuntimeError` \- `"This version already has a trained model. Please generate and train a new version in order to upload model to Roboflow."`

If upload is attempted for a model architecture that is not yet supported for weights upload, then you will receive a `ValueError`.

## Next Steps

1. 1.  
Test your model in the [Deploy Tab](https://blog.roboflow.com/deploy-tab).

2. 2.  
Run your model locally with [Roboflow Inference Server](https://inference.roboflow.com/).

3. 3.  
Deploy your Model with Roboflow Deploy.

4. 4.  
Improve your Model with [Active Learning](/api-reference/active-learning).
