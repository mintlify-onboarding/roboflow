Use the license server as a proxy for the Roboflow API.

## Using the License Server

If you wish to firewall the Roboflow Inference Server from the Internet, you will need to use the Roboflow License Server which acts as a proxy for the Roboflow API and your models' weights.

On a machine with access to `https://api.roboflow.com` and `https://storage.googleapis.com` (and port `80` open to the Inference Server running in your private network), pull the License Server Docker container:

```
sudo docker pull roboflow/license-server
```

And run it:

```
sudo docker run --net=host roboflow/license-server
```

Configure your Inference Server to use this License Server by passing its IP in the `LICENSE_SERVER` environment variable:

```
sudo docker run --net=host --env LICENSE_SERVER=10.0.1.1 roboflow/inference-server:cpu
```
