title: "Hosted API"
---

Models deployed to Roboflow have a REST API available through which you can run inference on images. This deployment method is ideal for environments where you have a persistent internet connection on your deployment device.

The API associated with your project scales with you: as you grow your project and have greater inference requirements, your API will grow.

## Task Support

The following task types are supported by the hosted API:

| Task Type                                                           | Supported by Hosted API                          |
