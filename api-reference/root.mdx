title: "REST API Structure"
---

You can retrieve information about your Roboflow projects and datasets using the REST API.

* `/` \- the [Root route](/api-reference/root) can be used to validate your API Key and find your workspace ID.

* `/:workspace` \- the [Workspace route](/api-reference/workspace) gives you information about your workspace and a list of its projects.

* `/:workspace/:project` \- the Project route shows information about a project and its versions.

* `/:workspace/:project/:version` \- the Version route surfaces information about a version, its trained model (if present), and exported datasets.

* `/:workspace/:project/:version/:format` \- the Format route is where you go to retrieve a download link for a zipped dataset in a particular [export format](https://roboflow.com/formats).

### Routes

To access the data for a resource, pass your `api_key` in the query string (in the documentation samples we have stored our `api_key` as an environment variable called `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` which you could do with `export ROBOFLOW_API_KEY="xxxxxxx"` (see below for how to obtain your API key from your account).

The data structure in Roboflow is largely hierarchical; the API layout matches this. [Workspaces](/api-reference/workspace) contain Projects which contain Versions which have trained models and are exported in various Formats.

### Root Endpoint

At the top level (`https://api.roboflow.com/`), you can verify your `api_key` is working. The response will tell you which `workspace` owns the key. 

Example for the `roboflow` workspace:

```
$ curl "https://api.roboflow.com/?api_key=$ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
{
    "welcome": "Welcome to the Roboflow API.",
    "instructions": "You are successfully authenticated.",
    "docs": "https://docs.roboflow.com",
    "workspace": "roboflow"
}
```

You can drill down into this workspace with its [Workspace endpoint](/api-reference/workspace) to access information about your projects.
