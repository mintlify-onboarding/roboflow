title: "Workspace and Project IDs"

To run inference on your model, or to query the Roboflow API endpoints associated with your project, you will need three pieces of information:

1. 1.  
Your project ID (AKA model ID, or project URL);

2. 2.  
Your model version number and;

3. 3.  
Your API key.

### How to Retrieve a Project ID and Version Number

To retrieve your project ID, go to the Version page associated with your trained model in the Roboflow dashboard.

At the top of the page, you will see a box that shows the project ID, the version number, and statistics about how the model performs:

The model ID is the text that appears before the forward slash character. The model version number is the number that appears after the forward slash.

You can also find this information by copying the URL of your model, which will something like this on the Versions page:

```
https://app.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/3
```

In this case:

1. 1.  
`license-plate-recognition-rxg4e` is the project ID and;

2. 2.  
3 is the version number.
