CLI

To retrieve information about a workspace and its projects, use the following Python code:

```
import roboflow

rf = roboflow.Roboflow(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE)

# List all projects for your workspace
workspace = rf.workspace()
```

The `/:workspace` endpoint gives you information about your workspace and its projects. You can dive in deeper to any project to find information about its generated versions, models, and dataset exports.

```
$ curl "https://api.roboflow.com/roboflow?api_key=$ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"
