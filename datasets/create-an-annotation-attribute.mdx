title: "Create an Annotation Attribute"

Annotation attributes (also referred to as "subclasses") can be added to your annotations using class specific attributes. These attributes are included in your dataset exports for object detection and segmentation projects.

## Create an Attribute

Attributes are added to classes in the Project Settings page.

From the Project Settings page you can view all of the classes in your project's dataset and add Annotation Attributes.
