You can upload images and annotations for object detection, classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

## How to Add Data

You can add data to your Roboflow account by:

* Using the Web Interface. **(Fastest for starting with** â‰¤**1000 images)**

* Using our [API](/datasets/adding-data#uploading-data-with-the-api)

* [Using an open source user generated dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/)

## Upload Data with the Web Interface

To upload data, first create a project if you do not have one already. When you first create a project, you will be asked to upload images:

Roboflow can accept the following types of data:

* JPG, PNG, and BMP images

## Access Public Datasets

[Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com) is a repository of over 200,000 datasets covering object detection, classification, and segmentation tasks. You can use Universe to find data for use in training the first version of a model, or for use in fine-tuning a model.

## Duplicate Images

If an image's content is the exact same, it will only counted towards your usage once. 

For example, if you [merge two datasets](https://docs.roboflow.com/merge-datasets), the merged dataset and the two original datasets exist in your account. Therefore, there is no charge for the merge, because the images are duplicates.
