title: "Export Versions"
---

You can export data from Roboflow at any time. You can export data using the Roboflow web interface or our Python package.

To export data, first generate a dataset version in the Roboflow dashboard. You can do so on the "Versions" page associated with your project.

After you have generated a dataset, click "Export" next to your dataset version:

You can download your data in a wide variety of formats. You can see a full list of supported export formats in the "Export" tab of our [formats directory](https://roboflow.com/formats).

After selecting an export format, you can choose to either download the data as a `.zip` file, or as a `curl` link to download from the command line.
