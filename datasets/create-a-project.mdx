### Projects in Roboflow

A project houses the images and annotations for your project. All projects exist within one workspace. Once images are annotated, they can generate a version, which is a copy of your images and annotations at the time, augmented and processed with the configuration you select. 

A project has a name, a type (ex: object detection) and an annotation group. For more information, take a look at the process of [creating a project](/datasets/create-a-project).

### Create a Project

First, go to the Roboflow dashboard. Then, click "Create New Project":

![](/images/datasets/Screenshot%202023-06-22%20at%2008.58.16.png)

You will be asked to specify:

1. 1.  
**A project type**. Here is a brief summary of each project type:  
   1. 1.  
   _**Object Detection**_: Find the location of objects in an image.  
   2. 2.  
   _**Single-Label Classification**_: Given a limited set of categories, assign a label to an image.  
   3. 3.  
   _**Multi-Label Classification**_: Given a limited set of categories, assign an arbitrary number of labels that are relevant to the image.  
   4. 4.  
   _**Instance Segmentation**_: To the pixel level, find the location of objects in an image.  
   5. 5.  
   _**Semantic Segmentation**_: To the pixel level, find the location of objects in an image and create unique references for each object found.

2. 2.  
**A project name:** The name of your project.

3. 3.  
**What you are detecting**: A label that summarizes what you are detecting.

When you have specified these values, submit the form to create the project.

_If you would like to see another type of project supported -- such as keypoint detection -- you can select the option from the dropdown of project types to indicate your interest._
