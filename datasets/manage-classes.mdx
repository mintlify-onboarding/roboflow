title: "Manage Classes"
---

You can view, modify, and manage your annotation classes from within the project settings. These changes impact all images in your project (unlike some of our [preprocessing steps](https://docs.roboflow.com/datasets/image-preprocessing#modify-classes), which only impact a version). As a result, these actions are best taken when you are certain you want to make changes to all of your images.

## How to access Project Settings

You can access Project Settings by clicking the 3-dot button to the right of your project name.

## Remapping Classes

Clicking on the `Manage Classes` button in the Project settings to see the class remapping options available.

From this menu, you can:

* Rename a class (by typing the new name in the `Override` column).

* Merge classes (by overriding multiple classes to the same name).

* Delete a class (by clicking the `Delete` checkbox).

WARNING: these actions are non-reversible and potentially destructive. Ensure you are comfortable with a change before proceeding.

## Locking Classes

You can check the `Lock Annotation Classes` checkbox to prevent the creation of new classes. This is useful for ensuring annotators do not accidentally add new classes during the labeling process.
