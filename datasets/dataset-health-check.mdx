Prefer to learn with video? We have a video tutorial that shows [how to use the dataset health check to improve model quality](https://youtu.be/aUFz6P4dtk4).

Health Check shows a range of statistics about the dataset associated with a project. You can see the following pieces of information:

* Number of images in your dataset;

* Number of annotations;

* Average image size;

* Median image ratio;

* Number of missing annotations;

* Number of null annotations;

* Image dimensions across your dataset;

* [Object count histogram](https://youtu.be/wzZOQNRgq5g), and;

* A heatmap of annotation locations.

Using health check, you can derive a range of insights about your dataset. For example, if you have no null annotations, you may want to consider adding a few depending on the project on which you are working; if there are images with missing annotations, you can dig deeper to add the requisite annotations.

See more on [the difference between null and missing annotations](https://blog.roboflow.com/missing-and-null-image-annotations/).

### Class Balance

The health check feature also shows class balance across your annotations. Class Balance shows how many of each object there are and easily visualizes class balance/imbalance. [Imbalanced data can yield unfavorable results, especially when measuring models with accuracy](https://blog.roboflow.com/handling-unbalanced-classes/).

Here is an example of the class balance feature in use:
