All computer vision projects in Roboflow belong to a workspace. When you sign up for a Roboflow account, we automatically create a workspace for you. Workspaces allow you to manage who has access to what projects and what features are available for projects inside the workspace.

### Create a New Workspace

After log in, to create a new Workspace, hover over the `+` icon and click the `+ Add Workspace` button on the nav menu after you log into Roboflow.
